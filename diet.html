            <p id="p1">
                Having a balanced diet and eating well during pregnancy means having a good variety of foods. <br>This will ensure you have the energy and nutrients you and your baby need during pregnancy.

             <p id="p2">
                Eating well is always important, but during pregnancy it can support your health and the health of your baby. It can be hard to think about eating well if you are feeling sick or tired and do not feel like spending time cooking. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself and focus on trying to have a variety of foods from the different food groups every day.

 Instead, choose foods that are unprocessed or minimally processed, including:
             </p>
             <ul>
                <li>fruit and vegetables</li>
<li>pulses, nuts and seeds</li>
<li>meat, fish and eggs</li>
<li>milk, cheese and yoghurt</li>
<li>foods such as potato, rice and pasta. </li>
             </ul>

            <h3 id="start">The Eatwell guide </h3>
            <p id="p5">On average, women should have around 2,000 calories a day. If you are in your third trimester of pregnancy you may need to eat an extra 200 calories depending on how active you are. The NHS has created an Eatwell Guide to help you understand how much of each food group should make up these 2000 calories. You do not need to follow these proportions for every meal, but try to get the balance over a day or even a week.

                <h3 id="s">Healthy Start: help with healthy food during pregnancy </h3>
                <p id="p6">Healthy Start is a government scheme in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The scheme offers vouchers to young pregnant women (under 18 years of age) and low income pregnant women or families with children under 4 years of age. These vouchers can be used to buy certain foods and vitamins and you must be at least 10 weeks pregnant to receive them. 

                    A similar scheme called Best Start Foods operates in Scotland. Find out more about these schemes on the First Steps Nutrition website.
                
          
                <h3 id="s1">I'm finding it hard to eat a balanced diet as so many foods make me feel sick. Could this harm my baby? </h3>
                <p id="p7">Many women feel sick during pregnancy, particularly in the first 3 months. When you are being sick quite often, it can feel like you are not providing your baby with the right nutrition. Try not to worry, there is no evidence that pregnancy sickness affects your baby’s nutrition. If are experiencing more extreme sickness and can’t keep anything down, you should talk to your midwife. </p>

                        Start the day with a healthy breakfast! This should help stop snacking between meals on foods that are high in fat and sugar.
