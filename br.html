            <p id="p1">
                Breast milk is a liquid source of food made by the human body to nourish babies.<br> Breast milk not only provides a child with complete nutrition, but it is also a source of protection against illness, including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

            <h3>Breast Milk Stages
            </h3>
            <p>
                The production of breast milk begins during pregnancy. When your baby is born, you will have only a small amount of milk for the first day or two. Don't worry; this is more than enough for your newborn. Your baby is getting enough milk if they have one wet diaper on day one, two wet diapers on day two, and so on.
            </p>
            <h3>Colostrum
            </h3>
            <p>
                Colostrum, the first type of breast milk, is present at the end of pregnancy and during the first few days after a baby is born. The amount of colostrum that your body makes is small, but that small volume contains everything your new baby needs in the first few days of life.
            </p>
            <h3>Transitional Milk
            </h3>
           <p>Transitional breast milk is a combination of colostrum and mature milk. When your breast milk begins to come in (three to five days after delivery), it mixes with colostrum and gradually transitions to mature milk over the course of a few days or a week.</p>
            <h3>Mature Milk
            </h3>
           <p>Milk changes over to mature breast milk by the time a baby is about two weeks old. Compared to colostrum, mature milk is lower in protein but higher in fat and carbohydrates. Mature milk contains about 90% water to meet your baby's fluid needs.</p>
            <h3>Breast Milk Supply
            </h3>
           <p>
            Your body begins to make breast milk in response to pregnancy and delivery of your child. But to continue making breast milk after your baby is born, you will need to breastfeed or pump.

By removing milk from the breasts, you will stimulate your body to make more milk. The more often you breastfeed or pump, the more milk you will make.
