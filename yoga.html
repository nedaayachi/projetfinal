                    Yoga involves a series of body positions (called postures or asanas) and breathing exercises (called pranayama). <br>It aims to build strength and flexibility to improve mental and physical wellbeing.<br> Pregnancy yoga classes use exercises that are safe during pregnancy.

                <p id="p2">
                    Keeping active during pregnancy has lots of benefits for you and your baby.<br> Yoga is a good option because it does not put too much strain on your joints.

                <p id="p3">
                    Research shows that yoga may reduce stress, anxiety and depression in pregnancy.

                <p id="p4">If you practice yoga during pregnancy, you may have a shorter labour and be more likely to have a vaginal delivery, if that is what you want. <br>Yoga can help you focus on your body and use your breath to stay calm, which may help you during labour.</p>
                <h3 id="start">Starting yoga</h3>
                <p id="p5">If you are new to yoga, look for a pregnancy class. It is a good idea to let your instructor know that you have not done yoga before. <br>They should be able to help you start off gently.<br>

                    There are many styles of yoga but you may prefer one of the gentler, slower paced styles such as Hatha.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Follow your teacher’s advice on which positions and exercises are suitable during pregnancy.</li>
                        <li>Keep cool ‒ avoid styles of yoga that involve heat, such as Bikram.</li>
                        <li>Be careful not to overstretch or push yourself too hard. You are more at risk of injury during pregnancy because your body produces a hormone, called relaxin, which softens the tissue between your joints.</li>
                        <li>Avoid lying on your back for long periods, especially after 16 weeks of pregnancy. </li>
                        <li>Stop if it hurts or you feel dizzy or out of breath.</li>
                        <li>Do not hold your breath – keep breathing deeply and evenly throughout the exercises.</li>
                      </ul>
