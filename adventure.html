            <p id="p1">
                It’s natural to feel a bit anxious when you’re pregnant.<br> But if you feel anxious most of the time and find it difficult to relax you may need help.

             <h3 id="t2">What is anxiety?</h3>
             <p id="p2">
                Anxiety is a feeling of unease, worry or fear, that can be mild or severe. Everyone feels anxious sometimes, but some people find it hard to control their worries. Some people with anxiety also have panic attacks, which can be very frightening.
             </p>
             <ul>
            
<li>feeling anxious all or most of the time and not able to control it</li>
<li>feeling very worried (for example, in pregnancy you may feel constantly worried about your baby)</li>
<li>being unable to concentrate, or feeling like your mind goes blank</li>
<li>difficulty falling or staying asleep. </li>
             </ul>

                    Anxiety in pregnancy is very common. More than 1 in 10 pregnant women have it. Don't feel like you are a failure because you're not coping.
               Pregnancy can be a very emotional experience and it can sometimes be difficult to know whether your feelings are manageable or a sign of something more serious. </p>

                <h3 id="t1">Does anxiety affect my baby?</h3>
                <p id="p1">
                    It is very unlikely that your baby will be affected by your anxiety, particularly if you get the right treatment and support.<br> So try to focus on asking for help and finding ways to manage your symptoms.

                    Tell your midwife or GP if you have experienced anxiety before even if you aren’t feeling anxious right now. The more they know about your mental health history the better they can support you during your pregnancy.

The midwife or doctor won’t criticise you or judge you for having these feelings. They know this happens to many pregnant women, and they will focus on finding the right treatment to help you recover.
